# Jumping_C

A Small project using Node, Express, MOngoDB Atlas, P5JS to replicate a popular Facebook viral image of a grid of "0"s with a hidden "C"
In this project the "C" will randomly jump around and will pull trivia questions from a 3rd party API to add more challange. Scores will be added and deducted and stored in the database for future play. Once all features functions properly, it will be deployed to Heroku.
