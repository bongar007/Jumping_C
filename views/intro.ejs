        Click on the "C" and answer the questions correctly to collect points. A
        "C" worth one point and a correct answer yields two points. If you
        answer incorrectly, you will lose two points. The program will track
        your high scores as well. It will not remember it after you close and
        reopen the browser window. This program in an ongoing design to practice
        JavaScript and have fun doing it. More features will be added as I can
        think of them. Have fun!!! You have got 1 minute! Tic-Toc...
